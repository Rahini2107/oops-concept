     - Java is oops based programming language. 
     - Java has many features mainly it is platform independent and object oriented.

 ## OOPs concept:
      The basics of OOPs concept are
            * Inheritance
            * polymorphism
            * Abstraction
            * Encapsulation
 ### 1.Inheritance:
         - In java inheritance is done with the help of the keyword "extends".
         - Inheritance is the concept of inheriting one class to another class.
         - Java does not support multiple inheritance in order to reduce the ambiguity i.e complexity.
         - multiple inheritance can be acheived through interfaces. 
         - other than multiple inheritance all other inheritance is supported in java.
         - Their are two classes in the inheritance one is the Sub-class and other is a Super-class.
         - The sub-class posses all the properties of the super-class and also its own unique properties. 
         - super class is the extended class of the sub class. 
         - Inheritance represents a IS-A relationship(parent-child relationship).
